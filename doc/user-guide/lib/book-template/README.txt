This book template features an elegant layout with a beautiful title page and
chapter headings. The book itself is highly structured into chapters, sections
and then subsections. Each is numbered and these numbers are prominently
displayed in the left margin where each begins as well as in page headers.
Sections and subsections also appear at the beginning of each chapter as a box
within the main header, although this behavior can be disabled if desired.
