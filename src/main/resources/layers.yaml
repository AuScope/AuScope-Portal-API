The image was generated by merging many individual airborne surveys and is a red-green-blue (RGB) composite using a histogram-equalised colour-stretch for each of the three channels. The red, green and blue channels represent K, Th and U respectively. Mixed compositions are indicated by the proportional blend of the corresponding additive primary colours (e.g. yellow indicates the presence of both K and Th, magenta the presence of K and U while aqua indicates the presence of Th and U). Black indicates low concentrations and white represents high concentrations for all three radioelements. The distribution of radioelements reflects the geochemistry and mineralogy of the near-surface, which may constitute either bedrock or regolith materials. The NSW statewide grid DVD set includes K values in percent(%), Th values in parts per million (ppm) and U values in parts per million (ppm)."

    description: "Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) provides a new, non-invasive mean for high resolution subsurface imaging in urban, developed environments by repurposing existing telecommunication cables. This DAS dataset is collected over 3 months between December 2021 and April 2022 at a fibre optic network dedicated to research, i.e., ALIRT (Australian Lightwave Infrastructure Research Testbed) in Melbourne, Australia. In this deployment, a 25 km long fibre optic cable is transformed into 6252 channels at 4 m spacing, starting from Melbourne Central Business District running west to east. Silixa iDAS interrogator is used, which measures strain-rate at 1 kHz with a fixed gauge length of 10 m. The time series recorded is decimated to 62.5 Hz. This dataset represents the ALIRT-001 Level 1 Decimated Data outputs."

    description: "Cloncurry Multi Element Toolkit and Laboratory (METAL) aims to shift the “Big Data” paradigm in mineral system science by developing a quantitative, fully integrated, multi-modal, scale-consistent methodology for system characterisation. The data comprises collocated petrophysical-mineralogical-geochemical-structural-metasomatic characterisation of 23 deposits from a highly complex mineral system. This approach allows translation of mineral system processes into physics, providing a framework for smarter geophysics-based exploration."
